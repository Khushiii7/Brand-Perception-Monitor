Reddit,u/SignatureFun954,"Leap scholar is just an business, i got a demo class for IELTS and they diagnosed my English skills, and said i was an below average user and said I still have an lot to learn Demotivated, they pushed me to buy their course , which i didn't. They just play with student's mentality and confidence to make them enroll or buy their services. P.S i got 7.5 bands in IELTS with only 1 month time and without any coaching.",2025-07-30 16:49:30,https://reddit.com/r/studying_in_germany/comments/1md3f10/can_yall_share_your_opinions_about_leap_scholar/n5yjncp/,,0.0

Reddit,r/IELTS,"Leap Scholar or British Council. I'm thinking of taking an IELTS coaching and I'm confused about which one will be the best. I'm thinking of taking a course because I'm at B1 level and I'm not confident in writing and speaking a lot. I'm from India. So, I'm not using English daily in my conversation.
